# IMDB Rating Prediction Project

## Introduction
Our team set out to predict IMDB ratings for upcoming films, applying various predictive models to gauge their expected ratings after release.

## Project Description
- **Objective**: Accurately forecast IMDB ratings using advanced statistical models.
- **Features**: We employed the polynomial model, log of the polynomial model and spline regression. Then we removed the insgnificatn variable and refinied them by removing insignificant variables to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Results Overview
We tested multiple models, analyzed their mean squared error (MSE), and derived predictions from our final selected model. Our comprehensive testing across different models helped us select the most accurate one for our predictions.
